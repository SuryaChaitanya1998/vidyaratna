### Problem solving

Problem Solving is the process of finding solutions to difficult or complex issues. 
Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications

### Steps to solve a problem :

There are only two steps needed in problem solving. They are:
1. Understand the given situation or problem clearly.
2. Then, put your idea to solve it in the form of code.

### Platforms to practice :

There are several online judges which conduct coding contests regularly in which one can participate to improve their coding skills. Short contests last for 2-5 hours, whereas long contests last from 10 days to one month. There are some contests which are held for years.

Few of the online judges are:

1. Topcoder.
2. Codeforces.
3. SPOJ.
4. A2OJ.
5. Codechef.
6. Hackerearth.
7. Hackerrank.

Several languages are available to code. C++ is mostly used by sport programmers, the next preffered language is Java followed by C. Other languages used are Python,PERL, Ruby, PASCAL, C#, Scala, Swift, etc.,

#### Different Topics under competetive programming

These are some of the important topics:

1. Mathematical Concepts like Probability, Combinatorics.
2. Graph Theory.
3. Number Theory.
4. Dynamic Programming.
5. Geometry.
6. Strings.
7. Greedy.

### Assignment

Solve the following problems in whichever language you are comfortable with. We will be evaluating your code, 
so don’t copy the code. Plagiarism is not the way to get into the club. Show us 
what you did and we’ll be happy with it :)
